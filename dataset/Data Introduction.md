# Data Introduction

| Property        | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **SMILES**      | See our proposal.                                            |
| **num_atoms**   | Number of atoms.                                             |
| **InChI**       | InChI (International Chemical Identifier) is also an identifier for molecules. It provides a standard way to describe the molecular structure in a more detailed manner than SMILES, often including information about stereochemistry and isotopic distribution. |
| **mu**          | Dipole moment, this scalar represents the overall polarity of a molecule; A higher dipole moment shows greater polarity, influencing molecular interactions and solubility (Polar solvents (like water) are effective at dissolving polar substances). |
| **alpha**       | Isotropic polarizability, this property measures how easily a molecule’s electron cloud can be distorted by an external electric field, similar to mu. Higher alpha can show more loosely held electrons, impacting reactivity and optical properties (The ease of distortion increases the molecule's ability to participate in interactions). |
| **homo**        | HOMO represents the energy of the highest filled electron orbital under normal conditions, showing the molecule’s ability to donate electrons. |
| **lumo**        | LUMO is the energy of the lowest orbital that can accept electrons. |
| **gap**         | Gap is the difference between the HOMO and LUMO. Smaller gaps often correlate with higher reactivity and better conductivity. |
| **U0, U, H, G** | All measure energies within molecules. Higher  energy also means less stability and a higher tendency to change or react to achieve lower energy states |
| **Hydroxyl**    | Hydroxyl groups (-OH) are found in alcohols and phenols and are characterized by a polar bond that can engage in hydrogen bonding, making compounds more soluble in water and generally more reactive. |
| **Carboxyl**    | Carboxylic (acids) (-COOH) contain both a carbonyl and a hydroxyl group attached to the same carbon, making them acidic. Often used in the manufacture of soaps and detergents (fatty acids). |
| **Ester**       | Esters (R-COO-R) are derived from carboxylic acids and alcohols. They are characterized by a sweet smell and are used in many biochemical reactions, including hydrolysis and transesterification. Often used in flavorings and fragrances. |
| **Amine**       | Amines (-NH2/-NH-) have C or H attached to the nitrogen. They can form hydrogen bonds and act as nucleophiles and bases in reactions. Used in dye manufacture and drugs. |
| **Amide**       | Amides (-CON-) have a carbonyl group bonded to a nitrogen. They are typically very stable due to resonance stabilization, making them less reactive. Often used in plastics and fibers like nylon. |
| **Ether**       | Ethers (R-O-R) have an oxygen bonded to two alkyl or aryl groups. They are relatively non-reactive and are used mainly as solvents. Used in laboratories. |
| **Alkene**      | Alkenes (R-C=C-R) contain a carbon-carbon double bond, which is reactive towards addition reactions, including hydrogenation and halogenation Used in the production of polymers and plastics through polymerization reactions. |
| **Alkyne**      | Alkynes (R-C**≡**C-R) have a carbon-carbon triple bond, which is even more reactive than double bonds in alkenes, undergoing similar addition reactions. Important in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and the vulcanization of rubber. |
| **Azo**         | Azo (R-N=N-R) compounds contain a nitrogen-nitrogen double bond. They are often used as dyes and can participate in electron transfer reactions. Used extensively in dyeing fabrics. |
| **Nitro**       | Nitro (R-NO2) groups are strong electron-withdrawing groups, making the compound more acidic and reactive towards reduction. Used in the manufacture of explosives like TNT and in pharmaceuticals. |
| **Nitrile**     | Nitriles (R-C**≡**N) feature a carbon triple-bonded to nitrogen. They are polar and can be hydrolyzed to carboxylic acids or reduced to amines. Used in the production of synthetic rubber, plastics, and acrylic fibers. |
| **Benzene**     | An aromatic ring (C6H6) with alternating double bonds, benzenes is stable due to its pi system. Often used as a precursor to make a variety of chemicals including plastics, resins, and synthetic fibers. |
| **Fluoro**      | Fluoro (R-F) compounds contain a carbon-fluorine bond, which is very strong making it less reactive. Fluorocarbons have been used extensively as refrigerants and propellants due to their low toxicity, stability, and suitable thermodynamic properties. |
| **Anhydride**   | Anhydrides (R-C(=O)-C(=O)-R) are derivatives of two carboxylic acids and are more reactive than esters, commonly used in acylation reactions. Used in the synthesis of various drugs |
